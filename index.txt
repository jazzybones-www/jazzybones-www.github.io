  the death of jazzybones

jazzybones started as a small journal for me to vent my frustrations in. since
then it's grown into the largest single collection of my writing in existence, a
combined literary, technical, and artistic project.

a piece of my soul has been embedded into this project. jazzybones started as a
public website, delisted from any search engine through robots.txt. the hope was
always that some far-off, anonymous audience would read it and finally
understand who i truly was, even if they didn't know my name or face. the
founding principle was that you can know who i am in real life, and you can know
who i am as a person, but you can't know both.

i feel like i've failed at that mission. as a paranoid programmer, i've done my
best to hide my real name and ip address from as many people as possible,
including github (the people that host this website) and protonmail (the people
that host my email). i've still screwed up, though. one time, i accidentally
pushed from my irl, personal github account. i then hid that activity, but
theoretically somebody at github could find my real name.

at the same time, as far as i'm aware, the anonymous audience that doesn't know
who i am, also doesn't exist. i haven't gotten a single non-automated email in
my inbox.

for those reasons, i've decided to kill this version of jazzybones. they will be
moving to a tor hidden service. email <jazzybones@proton.me> for the url.
